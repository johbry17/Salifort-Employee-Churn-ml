## Description

This project investigates the drivers of employee attrition at Salifort Motors using a real-world-inspired HR dataset, and includes statistical modeling and machine learning to support strategic HR decision-making. The workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Results communicated online, for both technical and general audiences
- Business recommendations for employee retention

All analysis is performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Features

- Interactive and visually-rich exploratory data analysis
- Multiple machine learning models for attrition prediction
- SHAP and feature importance visualizations for model interpretability
- Clean, web-friendly presentation of results for technical and non-technical audiences
- Actionable business recommendations

## Usage

All analysis can be found online at [project site](https://johbry17.github.io/Salifort-Employee-Churn-ml/).

1. Clone the repository.
