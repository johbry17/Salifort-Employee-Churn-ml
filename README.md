## Project Overview

**Salifort Motors** is a fictional car company facing high employee turnover. This project models and explains the drivers of attrition using a structured ML workflow:

- Data wrangling & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling with multiple classifiers
- Model evaluation and interpretability (SHAP, feature importance)
- Final recommendations for HR strategy and retention

Hosted online as an interactive web report aimed at both technical and general audiences.

## Features

- üìä Interactive visual EDA (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- ü§ñ Four predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- üîç Model evaluation: confusion matrices, recall scores, misclassification analysis
- üß† SHAP and feature importances for explainability
- üí¨ Executive summary with actionable business takeaways

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost, statsmodels, shap
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (HTML report)
